Hello welcome to the Repo.
Here I created my own world to study on various popular algorithm in order to enhace problem solving skills and also learning advance node js concepts. Preciate your time.

There are two main folders. Algorithm and Pattern.

- Algorithm you can find popular algorithmic problems and answers
- In pattern you will be facing advance Node.js concepts

  1.Algorithm

A.Problem Solving Patterns
-FrequencyCounterPattern
-TwoPointerApproach
-SlidingWindowPattern
-DivideAndConquer
-Recursion
B.Sorting Algoritms
-Bubble Sorting
-Selection Sorting

2.Pattern

-CallbackEvents (Sync , Async reading file , Observer Pattern)
-Asynchronous Control Flow Pattern with Callbacks
This prinsible comes with some important discipline

1. Exist as soon as possible , when a task is about the done , we always first to think early exist possibilities and implemenet into the task
   (Be careful the make any common mistake , such as when task early exit if you forget the terminate main taks this would cause an issue , so dont forget the terminate main task when you invoked to callback)
2. Create named functions for callbacks, keeping them out of closures and passing intermediate results as arguments. Naming our functions will also
   make them look better in stack traces.
3. Modularize the code. Split the code into smaller, reusable functions whenever possible.
